## Report a security issue

The project team welcomes security reports and is committed to
providing prompt attention to security issues. Security issues should
be reported privately via [Fastlyâ€™s security issue reporting
process](https://www.fastly.com/security/report-security-issue).

## Security advisories

Remediation of security vulnerabilities is prioritized by the project
team. The project team endeavors to coordinate remediation with
third-party stakeholders, and is committed to transparency in the
disclosure process. Since this repository does not contain any code
intended for use by Fastly customers, security vulnerabilities should
be reported using the [GitHub reporting
system](https://github.com/fastly/devex-reusable-workflows/security).

Note that communications related to security issues in
Fastly-maintained OSS as described here are distinct from [Fastly
Security Advisories](https://www.fastly.com/security-advisories).
